Bias\-Free Language



### Bias\-Free Language


The documentation set for this product strives to use bias\-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias\-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third\-party product.

Product overview


According to Cisco’s 2019 VNI Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast, mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a 46 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 2017 to 2022, two times faster than the growth of global IP fixed traffic during the same period. To help network providers meet these challenges, the Cisco® Network Convergence System 5500 Series is built with features such as high port densities, deep packet buffering, and forwarding hardware optimized for these types of deployments.


The Cisco NCS 55A1 are the second generation of fixed chassis available for the Cisco NCS 5500 Series. That new series offers three fixed configuration chassis, the NCS 55A1\-36H\-S, NCS 55A1\-36H\-SE\-S and NCS 55A1\-24H. These systems provide functionality vital to both the Top of Rack (ToR) and spine or leaf roles common to modern spine\-and\-leaf architectures. Capabilities such as advanced packet classification, segment routing, ultra\-wide ECMP, programmable network management and telemetry are added to the robust and mature features already present in Cisco IOS® XR Software Release 6\.3\.1\.


The Cisco NCS 55A1\-36H\-S and NCS 55A1\-36H\-S (Figure 1\) provide 36 ports of 100 Gigabit Ethernet with full line rate MACsec capability. All the ports can support 100GE and 40GE optics as well as 25GE to 10GE breakout. They use QSFP28/QSFP\+ form factor transceivers. They are designed for base and high scale configuration needs and are supported starting with Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6\.3\.1\.

The Cisco NCS 55A1\-24H (Figure 2\) provide 24 ports of 100 Gigabit Ethernet. All the ports can support 100GE and 40GE optics as well as 25G and 10GE breakout. This chassis uses QSFP28/QSFP\+ form factor transceivers. This chassis is designed for high scale configuration needs and is supported starting with Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6\.3\.1\.

Features and benefits


MACsec is a Layer 2 IEEE 802\.1AE standard for encrypting packets between two MACsec\-capable routers. MACsec secures the data on physical media, making it impossible for data to be compromised at higher layers. As a result, MACsec encryption takes priority over any other encryption method for higher layers, such as IPsec and SSL. MACsec provides encryption at Layer 2, which is provided by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm that replaces the DES algorithm. MACsec uses the MACsec Key Agreement protocol (MKA) to exchange session keys, and manage encryption keys.


Advantages of Using MACsec Encryption:


●     **Client\-oriented mode:** MACsec is used in setups where two routers that are peering with each other can alternate as a key server or a key client prior to exchanging keys. The key server generates and maintains the CAK between the two peers.


●     **Data integrity check:** MACsec uses MKA to generate an Integrity Check Value (ICV) for the frame arriving on the port. If the generated ICV is the same as the ICV in the frame, then the frame is accepted; otherwise, it is dropped.


●     **Data encryption:** MACsec provides port\-level encryption on the line card of the router. This means that the frames sent out of the configured port are encrypted, and frames received on the port are decrypted. MACsec also provides a mechanism with which you can configure whether only encrypted frames or all frames (encrypted and plain) are accepted on the interface.


●     **Replay protection:** When frames are transmitted through the network, there is a possibility of frames getting out of the ordered sequence. MACsec provides a configurable window that accepts a specified number of out\-of\-sequence frames.


●     **Support for clear traffic:** If configured accordingly, data that is not encrypted is allowed to transit through the port.


Cisco IOS XR Software overview


The Cisco NCS 55A1 Series fixed chassis is powered by industry leading carrier\-class 64\-bit version of Cisco IOS XR Software designed on operational efficiency, optimized utilization and service agility ([evolved programmable network](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/network-infrastructure/index.html)).
