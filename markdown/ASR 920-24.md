Major Applications


Broadband Access


Cisco ASR 920 routers support broadband access for delivering “any\-play” services (that is, voice, video, data, and mobility) to thousands of subscribers. Quality of service (QoS) on these routers can scale up to a large number of queues per device. This large number of queues, combined with a three\-level hierarchical QoS algorithm, can deliver an enhanced broadband user experience. This full\-featured Layer 2 switch and Layer 3 router supports a variety of broadband applications, including IPTV and video on demand (VoD), enhancing and extending the Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) architecture.


Converged Access for Mobile Applications


Deployed as a converged access platform for mobile backhaul, the ASR 920 router can aggregate multiple base stations through multiple Ethernet and IP interfaces, and it can use MPLS as a transport for mobile backhaul traffic. It also provides the Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) and IEEE\-1588 timing services required in today’s converged access networks. The model (ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM/ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM\-CC) has a built\-in GNSS receiver, which can act as a grandmaster clock for aggregating and backhauling small cell traffic. It also supports Cisco Universal Power over Ethernet (Cisco UPOE®) technology, which can be used to power small cell radios. The router can be deployed in small, completely sealed cabinets in outside environments, because of its small form factor and its durability in extended temperature ranges.


Advanced Security


Small cells deployments face challenges on the security front due to their location. The model (ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM/ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM\-CC) supports security service such as IP Security (IPSec) to help protect against vulnerabilities to subscriber traffic and the network. A built\-in hardware crypto engine allows the feature to scale and makes it ideal for extensive small cell deployments.


Metro Ethernet Access


The Cisco ASR 920 router is built to meet service provider requirements for Carrier Ethernet access. It is optimized for remote access and central offices, for smaller aggregation sites where a full\-featured, small\-footprint converged platform is needed. The router offers service flexibility and delivers Layer 2, IP, and MPLS transport for advanced L2VPN, L3VPN, and multicast services.


Major Differentiators


ASR 920 routers help service providers deliver differentiated, cost\-effective services such as residential broadband, mobile, and Metro Ethernet.


Flexible Deployment Options


ASR 920 routers are designed with a 1RU compact form factor to accommodate deployment in small spaces. ASR\-920\-24SZ\-IM model is 1\.5RU to accommodate the interface module in the chassis. Available with a range of mounting options, these routers can be deployed in space\-constrained locations and cabinets. The extended temperature range supported by ASR 920 router allows them to be deployed in locations with minimal environmental control. In addition, their small footprint allows service providers to extend the reach of their Carrier Ethernet networks to more challenging and remote locations.


Power\-Supply Unit: High Availability


ASR 920 routers offer a choice of AC and DC power supplies, which are redundant and built into the chassis. Ethernet interfaces are available in copper and fiber, with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps.   
 The time\-division multiplexing (TDM) interfaces are available in the product models (ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM, ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM\-CC and ASR\-920\-24SZ\-IM), with speeds ranging from n x DS\-0 to OC\-12/STM\-4 for plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH), SDH, and SONET. The interface modules, power supplies, and fan tray are all field\-replaceable.


Powered by the Cisco Carrier Ethernet ASIC


Powered by the Cisco Carrier Ethernet application\-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which was designed specifically for service providers, ASR 920 routers deliver essential Carrier Ethernet technologies, including hierarchical quality of service (HQoS), MPLS, and Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS). This custom and advanced ASIC design provides uninterrupted line\-rate performance while delivering complex services such as access control list (ACL) and HqoS. The Carrier Ethernet ASIC integrates Cisco traffic\-management innovation to deliver intelligent packet\-switching and routing operations.


Service Enhancement


In ASR 920 routers, each service is assigned enhanced QoS and security attributes. The router provides advanced per\-traffic\-class metering and offers bidirectional packet\-count and byte\-count statistics. The service offering is enhanced with operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) functions that include Layer 2 Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), IP service\-level agreements (SLAs) for Layer 3, and MPLS OAM.


Benefits


MPLS in the Access Layer


Cisco ASR 920 routers extend MPLS into the access layer by allowing service providers to initiate MPLS\-based Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services from within the access layer. These routers give service providers the ability to expand MPLS toward their network edge to gain the advantages of a single unified MPLS control plane across their networks. They offer full VPLS support, allowing multipoint services definition. For additional flexibility, VPLS can be deployed as a full mesh or as Hierarchical VPLS (H\-VPLS).


Incremental Investment Model


The return on investment (ROI) on an access element is heavily influenced by its location in the network and proximity to customers. The ability to deploy ASR 920 routers, then activate features later, on demand, delivers investment protection. This protection allows flexible timing for deploying MPLS and10 Gigabit Ethernet services and boosting service capacity.


Advanced Service\-Level Agreements


Service\-aware QoS allows service providers to expand and differentiate their services portfolio with highly advanced and differentiated SLAs. The HQoS capabilities of ASR 920 routers scale to eight queues per service, three levels of scheduling, and buffer volumes capable of accommodating today’s most demanding wireline and wireless applications.


Mobile Timing and Synchronization Services


ASR 920 routers provide the timing services required in a converged access network to support mobile solutions, including Radio Access Network (RAN) applications. They also support SyncE with Ethernet Synchronization Messaging Channel (ESMC) and Synchronization Status Messages (SSM) to allow excellent clock\-source traceability. In addition, the routers support IEEE\-1588, and the ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM/ASR\-920\-12SZ\-IM\-CC model has a built\-in GNSS receiver which can act as a grandmaster clock for aggregating and backhauling small cell traffic.


Operational Efficiency for Carrier Ethernet Access Deployments


Cisco ASR 920 routers feature major enhancements that help service providers simplify and facilitate network management, for reduced operational costs. With these innovative features, ASR 920 routers can be deployed in a variety of applications, including business services with 10\-Gigabit Ethernet User Network Interface (UNI) and Ethernet mobile backhaul. The features enhance performance awareness, facilitate troubleshooting, and simplify service turn\-up and restoration.”Dying gasp” for power indicators and four external alarm inputs also detect changes in remote sites, giving service providers additional tools to manage the health of network elements.


Universal Customer Premises Equipment


With all interfaces built in, this fixed\-form\-factor platform is versatile and can address many deployment scenarios, including Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet deployments. The licensing mechanism allows additional 1 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces to be activated as required for a particular deployment, so service providers can customize the configuration of the device and pay only when their services grow. With support for extended temperatures, ASR 920 routers can be deployed in outside environments and remote locations.
