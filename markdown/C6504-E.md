Bias\-Free Language



### Bias\-Free Language


The documentation set for this product strives to use bias\-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias\-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third\-party product.

  Product Overview

 Cisco introduces the Cisco® Catalyst® 6500 Enhanced Series Chassis (6500\-E Series) delivering up to 2 terabits per second of system bandwidth capacity and 80 Gbps of per\-slot bandwidth. In a system configured for VSS, this translates to a system capacity of 4 Tbps. The Cisco® Catalyst® 6500 Enhanced Series Chassis will be capable of delivering up to 180 Gbps of per\-slot bandwidth with a system capacity of up to 4 terabits per second. A system configured for VSS will be capable of delivering up to 8 Tbps of system bandwidth.

 The Cisco Catalyst 6500\-E Series Switch offers the broadest range of interface modules with industry\-leading performance and advanced feature integration. The Cisco Catalyst 6500\-E Series Switch also offers high port densities and comes in 3\-, 4\-, 6\-, 9, 9\-Vertical, and 13\-slot versions that make it ideal for a range of deployment scenarios.

 The Cisco Catalyst 6500\-E Series Chassis provides superior investment protection by supporting multiple generations of products in the same chassis, lowering the total cost of ownership. The Cisco Catalyst 6500\-E Series Chassis (Figure 1\) supports all the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Supervisor Engines up to and including the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Supervisor Engine 2T, and associated LAN, WAN, and services modules.
