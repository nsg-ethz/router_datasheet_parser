Product overview


Building on the success of the Cisco® Network Convergence System 5501 (NCS\-5501\), the Cisco Network Convergence System 55A1\-24Q6H\-S (NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-S) and 55A1\-24Q6H\-SS (NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-SS) offer improvements designed to meet the challenges of the zettabyte era. The NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-S and NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-SS provide dense 1G/10G/25G/40G/100G functionality in a 1\-rack\-unit package with line\-rate MACsec at 10G/25G/40G/100G speeds and Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)/1588 Class B timing. With ultralow per\-bit power consumption, deep packet buffering, and optimized forwarding architecture, the NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-S and NCS\-55A1\-24Q6H\-SS have the flexibility to be deployed across various network roles, including 5G Mobile Backhaul, Top of Rack (ToR), spine\-and\-leaf, and Converged Interconnect Network (CIN). Built to take full advantage of the advanced capabilities you have come to expect from Cisco IOS® XR, the NCS\-55A1 fixed\-chassis models boast advanced packet classification, segment routing, ultrawide Equal\-Cost Multipathing (ECMP), programmable network management, and telemetry to make your network smarter, faster, and more agile.
