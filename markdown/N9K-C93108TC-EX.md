Features and benefits


The Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches provide the following features and benefits:


●      **Architectural flexibility**


◦    Industry\-leading software\-defined networking solution Cisco ACI™ support.


◦    Support for standards\-based VXLAN EVPN fabrics, inclusive of hierarchical multisite support (refer to [VXLAN Network with MP\-BGP EVPN Control Plane](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/guide-c07-734107.html) for more information).


◦    Three\-tier BGP architectures, enabling horizontal, non\-blocking IPv6 network fabrics at web scale.


◦    Segment routing allows the network to forward Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets and engineer traffic without Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Traffic Engineering (TE). It provides a control\-plane alternative for increased network scalability and virtualization.


◦    Comprehensive protocol support for Layer 3 (v4/v6\) unicast and multicast routing protocol suites, including BGP, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2\), Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM\-SM), Source\-Specific Multicast (SSM), and Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP).


●      **Extensive programmability**


◦    Day\-0 automation through Power On Auto Provisioning, drastically reducing provisioning time.


◦    Industry\-leading integrations for leading DevOps configuration management applications – Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and SALT. Extensive Native YANG and industry\-standard OpenConfig model support through RESTCONF/NETCONF.


◦    Pervasive APIs for all switch CLI functions (JSON\-based RPC over HTTP/HTTPs).


●      **High scalability, flexibility**


◦    Flexible forwarding tables support up to 1 million shared entries on EX models. Flexible use of TCAM space allows for custom definitions of Access Control List (ACL) templates.


●      **Intelligent buffer management** 


◦    The platform offers Cisco’s innovative [intelligent buffer management](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/nexus-9000-series-switches/white-paper-c11-738488.html), which offers capability to distinguish mice and elephant flows and apply different queue management schemes to them based on their network forwarding requirements in the event of link congestion. 


◦    Intelligent buffer management functions are:


◦    Approximate Fair Dropping (AFD) with Elephant trap (ETRAP). AFD distinguishes long\-lived elephant flows from short\-lived mice flows, by using ETRAP. AFD exempts mice flows from the dropping algorithm so that mice flows will get their fair share of bandwidth without being starved by bandwidth\-hungry elephant flows. Also, AFD tracks elephant flows and subjects them to the AFD algorithm in the egress queue to grant them their fair share of bandwidth.


◦    Flows and subjects them to the AFD algorithm in the egress queue to grant them their fair share of bandwidth. 


◦    ETRAP measures the byte counts of incoming flows and compares this against the user\-defined ETRAP threshold. After a flow crosses the threshold, it becomes an elephant flow.


◦    Dynamic Packet Prioritization (DPP) provides the capability of separating mice flows and elephant flows into two different queues so that buffer space can be allocated to them independently. Mice flows, sensitive to congestion and latency can take priority queue and avoid re\-ordering that allows to elephant flows to take full link bandwidth.


●      **Hardware and software high availability**


◦    Virtual Port\-Channel (vPC) technology provides Layer 2 multipathing through the elimination of Spanning Tree Protocol. It also enables fully utilized bisectional bandwidth and simplified Layer 2 logical topologies without the need to change the existing management and deployment models.


◦    The 64\-way Equal\-Cost MultiPath (ECMP) routing enables the use of Layer 3 fat\-tree designs. This feature helps organizations prevent network bottlenecks, increase resiliency, and add capacity with little network disruption.


◦    Advanced reboot capabilities include hot and cold patching.


◦    The switches use hot\-swappable Power\-Supply Units (PSUs) and fans with N\+1 redundancy.


●      **Purpose\-built Cisco NX\-OS Software operating system with comprehensive, proven innovations**


◦    A single binary image that supports every switch in the Cisco Nexus 9000 series, simplifying image management. The operating system is modular, with a dedicated process for each routing protocol: a design that isolates faults while increasing availability. In the event of a process failure, the process can be restarted without loss of state. The operating system supports hot and cold patching and online diagnostics.


◦    Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is the network management platform for all NX\-OS―enabled deployments, spanning new fabric architectures, IP Fabric for Media, and storage networking deployments for the Cisco Nexus\-powered data center. Accelerate provisioning from days to minutes, and simplify deployments from day zero through day N. Reduce troubleshooting cycles with graphical operational visibility for topology, network fabric, and infrastructure. Eliminate configuration errors and automate ongoing change in a closed loop, with templated deployment models and configuration compliance alerting with automatic remediation. Real\-time health summary for fabric, devices, and topology. Correlated visibility for fabric (underlay, overlay, virtual and physical endpoints), including compute visualization with VMware.


◦    Network traffic monitoring with Cisco Nexus Data Broker builds simple, scalable, and cost\-effective network Test Access Points (TAPs) and Cisco Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) aggregation for network traffic monitoring and analysis.


●      **Cisco Tetration platform support**


◦    The telemetry information from the Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches is exported every 100 milliseconds by default directly from the switch’s Application\-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). This information consists of three types of data: (a) Flow information, this information contains information about endpoints, protocols, ports, when the flow started, how long the flow was active, etc. (b) Inter\-packet variation, this information captures any inter\-packet variations within the flow. Examples include variation in Time To Live (TTL), IP and TCP flags, payload length, etc. (c) Context details, context information is derived outside the packet header, including variation in buffer utilization, packet drops within a flow, association with tunnel endpoints, etc.


◦    The Cisco Tetration™ platform consumes this telemetry data, and by using unsupervised machine learning and behavior analysis, provides pervasive visibility across the data center in real time. By using algorithmic approaches, the Tetration platform provides deep application insights and interactions, enabling dramatically simplified operations, a zero\-trust model, and migration of applications to any programmable infrastructure. To learn more, go to <https://www.cisco.com/go/tetration>.


●      **Cisco Network Assurance Engine (NAE)**


◦    Cisco NAE continuously verifies if the network infrastructure is operating as per policy intent and leverages the power of mathematical models to reason on behalf of the operator at the policy, configuration, and dynamic state levels. NAE can precisely indicate problems in a network, can identify which applications or parts of a network are affected, and can diagnose root causes and suggest fixes. Its continuous verification approach transforms day\-2 operations from reactive to proactive, and it does so without using any packet data. NAE helps avoid outages by predicting the impact of changes, reducing network\-related IT incidents and shrinking the mean time to repair by up to 66 percent. NAE also helps ensure network security and segmentation compliance. To learn more about NAE, visit [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/data\-center\-analytics/network\-assurance\-engine/index.html](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/data-center-analytics/network-assurance-engine/index.html).
