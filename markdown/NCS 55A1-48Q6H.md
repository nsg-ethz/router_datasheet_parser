Product overview


According to Cisco’s 2019 VNI Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast, mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a 46 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 2017 to 2022, two times faster than the growth of global IP fixed traffic during the same period. To meet this growth economically, one of the architecture option available today is Centralized RAN (C\-RAN). In this architecture, the base station is separated into two parts, the Baseband Unit (BBU) and the Remote Radio Head (RRH). The baseband processing functions are centralized at the aggregation site resulting in more efficient use of resources. However, to interconnect the BBU and RRH higher speed interfaces are needed. 


The Cisco® Network Convergence System (NCS) 5500 Series offers a new fixed configuration chassis, NCS\-55A1\-48Q6H (Figure 1\) designed to support high density of interfaces up to 25GE. These systems can provide a cost\-effective solution by supporting WAN connectivity to RRH and LAN connectivity to BBU on a single platform. 


The Cisco NCS\-55A1\-48Q6H systems provide dense 1GE/10GE/25GE functionality needed for modern spine\-leaf architectures and Top\-of\-Rack (ToR) roles. Capabilities such as advanced packet classification, segment routing, ultra\-wide ECMP, programmable network management, and telemetry are added to the robust and mature features already present in Cisco IOS® XR Software Release 6\.6\.25\.
