 Major Applications

 Broadband Access

 The Cisco ASR 920 Router supports broadband access for delivering “any\-play” services (voice, video, data, and mobility) to thousands of subscribers, with quality of service (QoS) on the Cisco ASR 920 Router capable of scaling up to a large number of queues per device. The large number of queues, combined with the three\-level hierarchical QoS algorithm, results in an enhanced broadband user experience. This full\-featured Layer 2 switch and Layer 3 router supports a variety of broadband applications including IPTV and video on demand (VoD), enhancing and extending the Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) architecture.

 Converged Access for Mobile Applications

 Deployed as a converged access platform for mobile backhaul, the Cisco ASR 920 Router can aggregate multiple base stations through multiple Ethernet and IP interfaces and can use MPLS as a transport for mobile backhaul traffic. It provides the timing services required in today’s converged access networks by offering integrated support for the Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS), 1 Pulse Per Second (1PPS), and Time Of Day (TOD) interfaces. The Cisco ASR 920 Router also supports Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) and IEEE\-1588 and can act as the source for network clocking for time\-division multiplexing (TDM), SDH and SONET, and SyncE interfaces. In addition to the timing services, the Cisco ASR 920 Router can be deployed in small and fully sealed cabinets in outside environments because of its small form factor and durability in extended temperature ranges.

 Metro Ethernet Access

 The Cisco ASR 920 Router is built to meet service provider requirements for Carrier Ethernet access. It is optimized for remote access and central offices for smaller aggregation sites where a full\-featured, small\-footprint converged platform is needed. The Router offers service flexibility and delivers Layer 2, IP, and MPLS transport for advanced L2VPN, L3VPN, and multicast services.

 Major Differentiators

 The Cisco ASR 920 Router helps service providers deliver differentiated, cost\-effective advanced services such as residential broadband, mobile, and Metro Ethernet based on a variety of features.

 Flexible Deployment Options

 The Cisco ASR 920 Router is designed with a 1RU compact form factor to accommodate deployment in small spaces. Available with a range of mounting options, the router can be deployed in space\-constrained locations such as ETSI 300\-mm deep cabinets. A small footprint and extended temperature range allow service providers to extend the reach of their Carrier Ethernet networks to more challenging and remote locations.

 Power\-Supply Unit: High Availability

 The Cisco ASR 920 product family offers a choice of AC and DC power supplies. They are redundant and built   
 into the chassis. The Ethernet interfaces are available in copper and fiber, with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to   
 10 Gbps.

 Powered by the Cisco Carrier Ethernet ASIC

 Powered by the Cisco Carrier Ethernet application\-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which was designed specifically for service providers, the Cisco ASR 920 Series delivers essential Carrier Ethernet technologies including hierarchical quality of service (HQoS), MPLS, and Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS). This custom and advanced ASIC design provides uninterrupted line\-rate performance while delivering complex services such as access control list (ACL) and HQoS. The Carrier Ethernet ASIC integrates Cisco traffic\-management innovation to deliver intelligent packet switching and routing operations.

 Service Enhancement

 In the Cisco ASR 920 Router, each service is assigned enhanced QoS and security attributes. The router provides advanced per\-traffic\-class metering and offers bidirectional packet\-count and byte\-count statistics. The service offering is enhanced with operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) functions that include Layer 2 Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), IP service\-level agreement (SLA) for Layer 3, and MPLS OAM.

 Benefits

 MPLS in the Access layer

 The Cisco ASR 920 Series extends MPLS into the access layer by allowing service providers to initiate MPLS\-based Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services from within the access layer. The router gives service providers the ability to expand MPLS toward their network edge to gain the advantages of a single unified MPLS control plane across their networks. It offers full VPLS support, allowing multipoint services definition. For additional flexibility, VPLS can be deployed as a full mesh or as Hierarchical VPLS (H\-VPLS).

 Pay\-as\-You\-Grow Investment Model

 The return on investment (ROI) on an access element is heavily influenced by its location in the network and proximity to customers. The ability to deploy the Cisco ASR 920 Series and later activate features on demand delivers investment protection. This protection allows flexible timing for deploying MPLS and10\-Gigabit Ethernet services and boosting service capacity.

 Advanced Service\-Level Agreements

 Service\-aware QoS allows service providers to expand and differentiate their services portfolio with highly advanced and differentiating SLAs. The HQoS capabilities of the Cisco ASR 920 Series scale to eight queues per service, three levels of scheduling, and buffer volumes capable of accommodating today's most demanding wireline and wireless applications.

 Mobile Timing and Synchronization Services

 The Cisco ASR 920 Series provides the timing services required in a converged access network to support mobile solutions including Radio Access Network (RAN) applications, and offers integrated support for the Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS), 1 Pulse Per Second (1PPS), and Time Of Day (ToD) interfaces. The Cisco ASR 920 Series also supports SyncE with Ethernet Synchronization Messaging Channel (ESMC) and Synchronization Status Messages (SSM) to allow excellent clock\-source traceability. The Cisco ASR 920 Series supports IEEE\-1588, and can act as the source for network clocking for TDM, SDH and SONET interfaces, and SyncE.

 Operational Efficiency for Carrier Ethernet Access Deployments

 The Cisco ASR 920 Series features major enhancements that help service providers simplify and facilitate the management of their networks, resulting in diminishing operational costs. This innovative feature set allows the Cisco ASR 920 Series to be deployed in a variety of applications including business service with 10\-Gigabit Ethernet User Network Interface (UNI) and Ethernet mobile backhaul.

 These features enhance performance awareness, facilitate troubleshooting, and simplify service turn\-up and restoration, ultimately reducing operational costs. "Dying gasp" for power indicators and four external alarm inputs to detect changes in remote sites further help service providers manage the health of network elements.

 Universal Customer Premises Equipment

 With all interfaces built in, this fixed\-form\-factor platform is versatile and can cover many deployment scenarios including Gigabit Ethernet and 10\-Gigabit Ethernet deployments. The licensing mechanism supports enabling additional 1\-Gigabit/10\-Gigabit Ethernet interfaces as required for a particular deployment, allowing service providers to customize the configuration of the device and pay only when their services grow.
